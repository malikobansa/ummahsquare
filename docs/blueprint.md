## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Emerald Green (#289365) to represent unity and growth, drawing from the user's request to represent those ideals, but avoiding a literal reference
- Background color: Light green (#E0F8E9), a desaturated hue of the primary.
- Accent color: Gold (#D4A373) to symbolize prestige, an analogous color to Emerald Green. Significantly brighter than the primary, it will bring contrast to the page's elements
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) will offer a modern feel combined with warmth. A natural and reliable reading experience for users, well-suited for lengthier content, with shorter passages benefiting as well
- Use custom icons representing themes of unity, knowledge, and community.

- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement and visual appeal.
